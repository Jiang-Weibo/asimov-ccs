Contributions to ASiMoV-CCS are welcomed via pull requests.

When preparing a contribution we ask that you read the developers guide (see `dev_guide/`) to check for design and coding style intentions.
As described in the build tools documentation (`build_tools/build_system_readme.md`) the `flint` program is used to apply linting rules to the ASiMoV-CCS source.

Before a contribution is merged it will be reviewed by one of the ASiMoV-CCS developers, in particular the full test suite must still pass.

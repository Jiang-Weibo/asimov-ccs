  !> @details Packing matrix coefficients may modify the index according to the backend in use,
  !!          however this should never result in an index range greater than the size of the
  !!          matrix, i.e. (idx_max - idx_min) <= N --- I suppose this is possible for a backend
  !!          using globally non-contiguous indices but that seems unlikely.
